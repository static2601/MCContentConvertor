models not running bat either...
game folder needs to be correct, if you need to do a temp folder, add an option and goto root/temp.
You must also have the program FAIL if something fatal happens like this, else very hard to figure out 
it happened.

for materials, had to take out vtfLocation:[
chest1 path
chest2 path
chest3 path

made them all: "path"

worked to stop repeating material path in unique
will need to look at why this happened and come up with a solution.

also, look into moving everything into textures and rename to temp so we can 
gitignore it and delete it everytime we refresh the textures
also move qcs in there with smds in the main directory, not git ignored

studiomdl wil need to be carried with the project and placed in team fortress 2/bin or whichever gmae dir
it needs to go if its nto in there already.

textures still not compiling, figure out why. and clean up the code there also.
and it seems I was trying to make a temp folder for vtfs then move but, if we delete the main folder, 
shouldnt have to do that.

back up everything and delete all the garbage from the scripts.

scale does set properly now so just get those bat file running and all is good there.

on compiling models, alot of stupid errors:
Error opening D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\models/props/minecraft_original/RedstoneSwitch.vvd! (Check for write enable)
check QC, nothing abnormal in paths
then,
D:\Coding Projects\ProjectFiles\IdeaProjects\MaterialCreator\QCs>c
'c' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

models were missing, invisible in the map. something in the past, this happens, now i remember, compiler had to be run multiple times to get everything compiled.
more vvd errors

was this name cutoff?
D:\Coding Projects\ProjectFiles\IdeaProjects\MaterialCreator\QCs>s_3.qc
's_3.qc' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

D:\Coding Projects\ProjectFiles\IdeaProjects\MaterialCreator\QCs>

scales are still 0.0...
