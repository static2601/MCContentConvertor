MC Content Convertor extracts all textures from the Minecraft jar and converts to vtf and vmt files
for use in Source games like Team Fortress 2, GarrysMod and Counter Strike. This is mostly for making
the textures needed for Soucecraft, a Minecraft world convertor originally created by Garten, but could
be used for any Source project.

This is a work in progress, I have just recently gotten it to a point where I can make a release.
All textures should be displayed properly, animations are still a work in progress and not included
yet. Many of the models have been created through blender and textured. I have not uploaded a release yet
as I am still testing to make sure everything works as I intended. I plan on creating more documentation on
this and Sourcecraft in the future.
